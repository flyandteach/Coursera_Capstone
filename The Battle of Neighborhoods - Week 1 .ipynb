Thus, new businesses requires careful planning and analysis prior to execution. This analysis will provide an overview of local competition in the coffee marketplace. Considering the coffee business is dominated by global brands and tends to be saturated in urban areas, details about comparable competition and access to heavy customer traffic is paramount to potential success."
